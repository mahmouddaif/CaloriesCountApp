## Introduction

Calories count is a web application developed using rstudio shiny package, and hosted on shinyapps.io

## How It Works

The app uses Harris Benedict Equation.
It first Calculates BMR using the variables of height, weight, age and gender to calculate the Basal Metabolic Rate:


```{}

Women: BMR = 655 + ( 9.6 x weight in kilos ) + ( 1.8 x height in cm ) - ( 4.7 x age in years )

Men: BMR = 66 + ( 13.7 x weight in kilos ) + ( 5 x height in cm ) - ( 6.8 x age in years )

```

## How It Works
The Harris Benedict Equation is a formula that uses your BMR and then applies an activity factor to determine 

your total daily energy expenditure (calories). 

```{}
If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.2

If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.375

If you are moderatetely active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.55

If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.725

If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.9

```

## Code Example

Here's a code example that calculates the needed calories for a 70 kg, 25 years old, 181 cm tall, moderately active male.

```{r}

bmr <- 66 + ( 13.7 * 79 ) + ( 5 * 181 ) - ( 6.8 * 25 )

calories <- bmr * 1.55

calories

```
